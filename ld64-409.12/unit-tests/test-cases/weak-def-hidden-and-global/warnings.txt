ld: warning: direct access in function '_test' from file '/var/folders/pm/6jgmcb416_sbd6ky4l2rhqjr0000gn/T/myhidden-7d8c48.o' to global weak symbol '_myweak' from file '/var/folders/pm/6jgmcb416_sbd6ky4l2rhqjr0000gn/T/myglobal-e2043b.o' means the weak symbol cannot be overridden at runtime. This was likely caused by different translation units being compiled with different visibility settings.
